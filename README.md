To practice resolving **Git merge conflicts** between `main` and `feature` branches using Git commands.  

## üõ† Tools Used  
- **Git** ‚Üí Version control system  
- **VS Code / Command Prompt** ‚Üí For editing and running Git commands  
- **GitHub** ‚Üí To store and share the repository  

## üßæ Steps Performed  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Repository  
```bash
git init

echo "Welcome to DevOps Simulator - main branch" > simulator.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit on main branch"

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Commit in Feature Branch

git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between main and feature-branch"

6Ô∏è‚É£ Push to GitHub
